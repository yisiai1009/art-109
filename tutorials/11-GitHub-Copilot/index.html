      <p>
        It is hard to imagine a future internet without thinking about faster devices or new apps. But when I picture the future—fifty or even one hundred years later—I don’t imagine a cleaner phone or a smarter laptop. I imagine something that no longer sits in our hands at all. I imagine an internet that reacts to thought, follows intention, and becomes a space we enter instead of a screen we stare at.
      </p>

      <p>
        The biggest change will be how people interact with information. Instead of typing searches or talking to assistants, people will send commands through intention. Not full thoughts, not private memories—just signals similar to deciding to move your arm. If you think <em>I want to see that file again</em>, the file appears.
      </p>

      <p>
        Communication will also feel different. Instead of video calls, people will appear next to each other as digital bodies. You could sit on a friend’s couch, look around their room, or touch their dog without leaving your home.
      </p>

      <p>
        Work and school change too. A team could gather around the same table even if they live in different cities. Students might share a virtual lab instead of commuting. “Remote work” stops being separate from regular work—everything blends.
      </p>

      <p>
        Browsing information also shifts. Instead of scrolling, you walk through digital spaces shaped by your interests. A video becomes a doorway. A store becomes a street. You leave the space, and the content stops following you.
      </p>

      <p>
        The network behind all this must be different. It becomes a system that reorganizes itself without waiting for engineers. Outages fix themselves. Connection covers land, ocean, and maybe space.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another possibility is a parallel world—a digital layer matching the physical one. You could visit parks, shops, or landmarks without travel. You switch layers, not worlds.
      </p>

      <p>
        Memory storage also changes. People might save fragments of themselves—voice patterns, habits, stories. Not full minds, but pieces families can keep.
      </p>

      <p>
        The line between “online” and “offline” disappears. If intention becomes the main input, you don’t “go online.” You shift attention. The network fades into the background.
      </p>

      <p>
        If someone in 2125 asks, “Are you online?”, the question may not make sense. A better one might be: “Where is your attention right now?”
