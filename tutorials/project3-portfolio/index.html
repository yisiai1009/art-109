      <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
      <p>
        As a digital media artist and photographer, I explore how image, story, and technology can intertwine to capture
        emotion, memory, and the quiet details in everyday life. Photography is where I first learned to pay attention —
        to light, to relationships, and to the ways people inhabit space together. Over time, my practice has expanded
        into interactive and web-based work, allowing these stories to move, react, and breathe beyond the frame. I’m
        interested in how digital tools can deepen connection instead of replacing it, and how small moments become
        meaningful when they are shared. Through portraiture, documentary work, and browser-based experiences, I hope to
        build spaces that feel honest, warm, and alive.
